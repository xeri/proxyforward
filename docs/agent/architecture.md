**Life of a player byte**: player TCP → gateway public listener (bound by the actor)
→ `connGate.admit` → `mux.OpenStream()` + `open_conn{tunnelID, clientAddr, connID}`
header → agent `handleDataStream` → dial local server (optional PP2 header first) →
`relay.Splice` on both sides (gateway splices player↔stream, agent splices
stream↔local; Minecraft-aware tunnels wrap the client leg in `mcsniff.Tap`).
Counters: per-conn `conntrack.Entry` (atomics) → 2 Hz status + 10 Hz `stats.Sample`
→ SQLite via the 45 s flush; gateway samples kernel RTT per conn every 5 s and ships
it over `conn_stats` so both ends attribute per-player ping.

**Bandwidth cap** (`internal/bwcap`): a tunnel's `BandwidthLimitMbps` (+ scope: combined
| per-direction | per-connection) throttles the splice on **both** sides via
`golang.org/x/time/rate` — one token = one byte, rate = `Mbps × 125_000` (decimal), burst
= `relay.BufSize`, so `WaitN(n)` with n ≤ that never trips the burst. Buckets are keyed
per **`(agentID, tunnelID)`**: the gateway hangs the `bwcap.LimiterSet` on the tunnel's
`publicListener` (two agents' same-named tunnels cap independently), the agent keys a
`bwcap.Registry` by tunnel ID. `mbps ≤ 0` is the byte-identical uncapped fast path (nil
`relay.Limiter`, no per-iteration cost, no per-splice context). A throttled `WaitN`
unblocks on the session ctx, cancelled by gateway `evict` / agent session teardown.

**Go↔JS boundary**: methods on `app.App` (promise-returning bindings) + the 2 Hz
`tick` event; attached mode proxies the same data over the pipe, analytics on its own
pipe conn so slow queries never stall the tick (`app/analytics.go`). The Wails
generator can't model cross-package embedded structs or `time.Time` — use app-local
mirror types and unix-ms ints (`app.go UIStatus`, `logging.Entry`).

**State lives**: config = TOML at `%APPDATA%\proxyforward\config.toml`
(service: `%ProgramData%\proxyforward`), atomic save (`config/`); history/analytics =
`analytics.db` next to it (owner-process only); GUI = `useTick` + polled hooks with
module caches; theme/motion/fx/chart prefs = localStorage (`pf-*` keys), theme also
persisted to config.

## Control-plane message flow

Hello (pre-mux, pre-auth caps apply) → `hello_ok{generation, capabilities, hostname,
localIps, observedIp}` | `hello_err{code}` → mux starts (client=agent) → agent opens
the control stream → tunnel registration:
- Capability `tunnel-sync`: one `sync_tunnels{seq, tunnels[]}` desired-state frame;
  gateway's actor reconciles (identical specs keep listeners + live conns:
  `actor.reconcile`), answers `sync_result` (stale seq dropped agent-side).
- Legacy: per-tunnel `register_tunnel`/`unregister_tunnel` + `register_ok|register_err`.
Steady state: `ping/pong` both directions (RTT/jitter/loss both sides; pong echoes
`recvUnixNano` for one-way estimates); agent pushes `health{tunnelId, localUp}` on
probe transitions; gateway pushes `conn_stats{[{c,r}]}` (cap `conn-stats`) mapping
kernel RTT onto agent conn entries via `ConnKey`. Data streams: gateway →
`OpenStream` + `open_conn{tunnelId, clientAddr, connId}` header, then raw bytes.

## Analytics data model (`internal/analytics/schema.go`)

- `rrd(tier,t,…)` — persisted image of stats tiers 2–4 (28 OHLC/gauge columns; −1 =
  unknown). Written incrementally on flush via dirty watermarks (`statspersist.go`).
- `sessions` — one row per proxied connection: conn_key, tunnel, ip:port, times,
  bytes, sniffed player name/protocol, resolved `player_uuid` (backfilled ≤6 h,
  `identity.go backfillWindow`), geo (cc/asn/as_org), running rtt_avg/min/max/n.
- `session_traffic` / `session_rtt` — 15 s deltas and per-minute RTT aggregates for
  the replay timeline; orphans swept by the daily prune.
- `players`, `player_names`, `player_ips` — identity + locally-observed history
  (Mojang killed the name-history API in 2022; renames come from 24 h profile
  re-checks of players actually seen). Offline players key as `offline:<name>` and
  reconcile onto the real UUID if it later resolves (`reconcileOffline`, which also
  re-rolls affected rollup buckets).
- `uuid_cache` / `geo_cache` — resolution caches ('' uuid = confirmed miss).
- `rollup_hourly` / `rollup_daily` / `peaks` — dashboard aggregates; idempotent
  INSERT-OR-REPLACE rollups every 5 min from rrd tier 2 + sessions (`rollup.go`);
  lapped hours are never re-rolled (would zero them).
- `events(kind: link|tunnel_local|engine)` — uptime transition journal; `engine`
  rows bracket runs so off-time counts as *unknown*, not down (`summary.go
  engineCoverage`); prune parks a synthetic carrier row at the cutoff.
- Migrations: append-only ladder in `migrations` (`schemaV1`, `schemaV2`, …),
  `PRAGMA user_version` tracked, each step transactional. Never edit an applied step.
- Ownership: exactly one process opens the DB (WAL safety on Windows); one writer
  connection + a query_only read pool of 4; unreadable DB → renamed `.bad` +
  recreated — analytics must never block engine start (`db.go Open`).

## Stats store (`internal/stats/`)

Five ring tiers; a completed bucket cascades into the coarser tier (`add`). Rates are
OHLC of bytes/sec; conn/RTT/players/loss are gauge OHLC with −1 = unknown, and
`mergeGauge` skips unknown sides so pre-upgrade data never poisons merges. Sampling
is delta-of-monotonic-totals with re-baseline on shrink (restart-safe). History
queries pick the finest tier covering the window, then group to ≤300 buckets.
Persistence is the `Persister` seam — SQLite in production (`analytics/statspersist.go`),
fakes in tests; legacy `stats.json` (v1–v3 packed arrays) imports once then renames
to `.imported` (`importjson.go`).

## Avatar pipeline (`app/avatars.go`)

`/pf/avatar/<id>.png?size=N` on the Wails asset server (id regex = path-traversal
guard; sizes clamp 16–128). One 8×8 *master* face per player id — Mojang profile →
skin → compose face+hat locally, else mc-heads.net, else crafatar, else procedural
Steve/Alex placeholder — every size is a nearest-neighbor upscale, cached on disk.
Requests never block on network: cold ids answer an instant `no-cache` placeholder
while a bounded background warm builds the master (singleflight per id); failures
write a 15-min `.miss` marker and are never cached as real heads. Frontend
counterpart: `AvatarImg` re-asks on a short backoff until the long-lived render
lands (`components/AvatarImg.tsx`). In browser dev the asset server doesn't exist —
`avatarUrl` falls back to mc-heads / inline SVG (`avatars.ts`).

## Frontend data layers

| Layer | Source | Cadence | Cache |
|---|---|---|---|
| `state.ts useTick` | `tick` event + initial `Status()` | 2 Hz push | none (live) |
| `history.ts` | `BandwidthHistory(windowMs, buckets)` | 250 ms–60 s per range (`RANGES`) | module map per range |
| `players.ts` | Players/PlayerDetail/History/Latency | 5–15 s | module maps |
| `analytics.ts` | Summary/PeakMatrix/Uptime/Sessions/Timeline/Geo | 15–60 s | module maps |
| `Activity.tsx` | `LogsSince(seq)` | 4 Hz | ring-capped 2000 |

Shared plumbing: `usePolled` (null key pauses; cache gives instant paint),
`useDebounced` for search. Cross-screen handoff without a router: module-level
mailbox (`players.ts openDossierOnMount`). Title-bar context: `pagecontext.ts`
(`useSyncExternalStore` module store). Chart vocabulary: `charts/util.ts` (binary
vs 1/2/5 axis scales, measured width, time ticks, 220 ms timestamp-keyed tween that
snaps under reduced motion). The world map is pre-baked Natural Earth 110m
equirectangular paths (`worldgeo.ts`, generated — regenerate, don't edit).

## devmock axes (the UI test matrix, `frontend/src/devmock.ts`)

`?mock=agent|gateway|wizard` plus composable: `&link=down`, `&mode=attached`
(gated bindings reject like the real backend), `&fatal=1`, `&fresh=1`,
`&analytics=off`, `&paired=0` (never paired to a gateway — the sidebar's role
switcher cannot become the agent and must route to setup), `&geo=off|empty|error|pending`,
`&fx=low|high`, `&fleet=multi|old` (gateway only — `multi`: a five-agent fleet with a
good/fair/poor health spread instead of the default single agent, for the Agents roster
+ drill-in; `old`: a pre-roster daemon that sends no agents array → the roster's
honest-unavailable state). The traffic model is deterministic functions of absolute time, so
chart/tiles/replay all agree at any poll cadence. When you add a binding, add its stub
here or the mock throws. Role setup mutates the mock's role, so the switcher flips the
whole app live in the browser with no Go running.

## Windows integration corners

- Service: kardianos/service, `service run` reads `%ProgramData%` config
  (seeded from the user's on install), OnFailure=restart, fatal engine errors exit(1)
  so the SCM restarts (`svc/service.go`).
- Elevation: `ShellExecuteExW "runas"` relaunches `proxyforward elevated-task <one
  task>`; the main process never elevates (`svc/elevate_windows.go`).
- Firewall: program-scoped rule (port changes need no new prompt), delete-then-add
  idempotence, exit-code detection (`svc/firewall_windows.go`).
- Reconnect triggers: `NotifyAddrChange` loop (heap-pinned OVERLAPPED) + wall-clock
  jump resume detector (`netnotify/`).
- Kernel RTT: `SIO_TCP_INFO` v0 (Win10 1703+), best-effort (`tcpinfo/`).
- Port conflicts: `GetExtendedTcpTable` → "in use by java.exe (PID 1234)"
  (`portowner/`).
- Console attach for windowsgui builds: `wincon.AttachParent()` at the top of every
  CLI subcommand — new subcommands must call it too.
